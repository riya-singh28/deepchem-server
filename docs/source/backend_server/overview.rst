Overview
--------

DeepChem Server provides a comprehensive API for molecular machine learning workflows. The API is organized into several layers:

* **REST API**: HTTP endpoints for data upload, featurization, and retrieval
* **Core Modules**: Python modules that implement the server functionality  
* **Utilities**: Helper functions and utilities used throughout the system

For interactive API testing and the most up-to-date endpoint documentation, visit http://localhost:8000/docs when your server is running.
