Py-DS Library
=============

The py-ds library provides a Python client for interacting with DeepChem Server. It offers a convenient, programmatic way to upload data, run featurization tasks, and manage datasets without dealing with raw HTTP requests.

Overview
--------

The py-ds library simplifies common workflows by providing:

* **High-level functions** for data upload and featurization
* **Error handling** and retry logic for robust operations
* **Batch processing** capabilities for handling multiple datasets
* **Integration helpers** for popular data science tools

Installation
------------

Install the py-ds library using pip:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install py-ds

Or install from source:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd py-ds
   pip install -e .

Configuration
-------------

Configure the library to connect to your DeepChem Server using environment variables, configuration files, or programmatically. For detailed configuration options, refer to the module documentation.

Interactive API Testing
-----------------------

For the most up-to-date examples and interactive testing of the underlying API that the py-ds library uses, visit http://localhost:8000/docs when your DeepChem Server is running.

The Swagger UI provides:
